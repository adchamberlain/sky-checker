• Tips for optimal viewing based on current conditions

PLANNING TOOLS
• Equipment difficulty ratings (Naked Eye, Binoculars, Telescope)
• Rise, set, and peak viewing times with compass directions
• Date picker to plan future observing sessions
• Share tonight's sky with friends and family

POWERFUL FEATURES
• Automatic GPS location detection

• Smart caching for fast app launch
• Elegant retro terminal-style interface with ASCII art

HOW IT WORKS
SkyChecker connects to NASA's Horizons Ephemeris System — the same data source used by professional astronomers — to calculate precise positions for celestial objects based on your exact location and time zone.

Weather data comes from Open-Meteo, providing real-time cloud cover, visibility, and atmospheric conditions to help you plan the perfect observing session.

PERFECT FOR
• Casual stargazers curious about tonight's sky
• Amateur astronomers planning observation sessions
• Educators teaching astronomy concepts
• Anyone who's ever looked up and wondered "what's that?"

PRIVACY FOCUSED
Your location stays on your device. We don't track you, collect personal data, or show ads. The only external connections are to NASA's public astronomical database and Open-Meteo weather service.

Clear skies! 🌙✨
