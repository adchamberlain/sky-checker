Discover what's visible in the night sky tonight — right from your backyard.

SkyChecker uses NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory data to show you exactly which celestial objects are visible from your location. No guesswork, no complicated star charts — just a simple list of what you can see and when.

WHAT YOU'LL SEE
• The Moon with current phase and illumination percentage
• All visible planets from Mercury to Neptune
• Rise, set, and peak viewing times
• Compass directions for easy locating
• Beautiful ASCII art Moon phase display

POWERFUL FEATURES
• Automatic GPS location detection
• Manual coordinate entry for precise locations
• Date picker to plan future observing sessions  
• Offline caching for areas with poor connectivity
• Elegant retro terminal-style interface

HOW IT WORKS
SkyChecker connects to NASA's Horizons Ephemeris System — the same data source used by professional astronomers — to calculate precise positions for celestial objects based on your exact location and time zone.

The app automatically determines sunset and sunrise times, then shows you only the objects that will be above the horizon during nighttime hours.

PERFECT FOR
• Casual stargazers curious about tonight's sky
• Amateur astronomers planning observation sessions
• Educators teaching astronomy concepts
• Anyone who's ever looked up and wondered "what's that?"

PRIVACY FOCUSED
Your location stays on your device. We don't track you, collect personal data, or show ads. The only external connection is to NASA's public astronomical database.

Clear skies! 🌙✨
