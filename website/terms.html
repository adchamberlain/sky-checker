                <p>
                    SkyChecker is an iOS application that provides information about
                    celestial object visibility based on your location. The app uses
                    data from NASA's JPL Horizons System to calculate rise times, set
                    times, and positions of the Moon and planets.

                <h2>> Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                    While SkyChecker uses professional-grade ephemeris data, astronomical
                    calculations are provided for informational and entertainment purposes.
                    Actual visibility may be affected by weather, light pollution,
                    atmospheric conditions, and other factors not accounted for by the app.

                    SkyChecker is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. The
                    developer is not liable for any damages arising from the use or
